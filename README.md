## Description

This is a collection of work from my experience in the techNL Digital Skills Bootcamp, 2024. This includes files of graphic design, python programming, and course certifications.
In addition, I have done CAD modelling and simple game design. Below is a descriptive walkthrough of these diverse projects and learning experiences.

### Graphic Design

I created both a logo design and poster creation using Canva for an imaginative businness concept, named "Noshin's Knits & Crafts." It incorporated an understanding of how to make graphic art uniquely eye-catching, which includes having different textual and visual elements.

### Python Programming 

From this python coding experience, I was able to make a Number Guessing Game and a Python Calculator. The Number Guessing Game and Python Calculator displays my learning of assigning a variable and input functions. Other python projects included data visualization and data analysis, where I learned how to import different libraries and code a variation of graphs (e.g., histgraph, bargraph, scatterplot, etc). Along with this, I collected my own Sleep Schedule data and looked for trends and insights. This was all done using Replit.
